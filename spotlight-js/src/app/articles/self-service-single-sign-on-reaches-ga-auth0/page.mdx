For enterprise SaaS applications, self-service SSO is no longer optionalâ€”itâ€™s an expectation. It enhances security, accelerates onboarding, and signals that your platform is built to meet enterprise needs.

Thatâ€™s why Auth0 now offers Self-Service SSO, designed to help you:

Enhance Security: Centralize authentication to reduce risks and simplify compliance.

Streamline Onboarding: Enable IT teams to configure SSO with their Identity Providers (IdPs) like Okta ðŸ˜‰, Azure AD, or Google Workspace without extra support.

Support Enterprise Growth: Offer seamless integration and empower customers to get up and running faster.

Auth0â€™s Self-Service SSO includes:

- Easy integration with popular IdPs.
- Intuitive testing workflows for smoother deployments.
- Comprehensive documentation to guide admins step-by-step.

Whether youâ€™re improving your onboarding process or scaling for enterprise customers, self-service SSO is a critical piece of the puzzle.
