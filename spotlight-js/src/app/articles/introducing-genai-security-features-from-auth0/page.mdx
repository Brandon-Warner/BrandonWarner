The race to integrate the latest AI innovations is on!

Product teams and developers are eager to leverage the transformative power of AI agents to create groundbreaking applications. However, this rapid adoption can introduce significant security risks if not managed carefully.

Granting AI agents unspecified permissions across third-party integrations and sensitive user data is a recipe for potential disaster.

Enter Auth0's latest breakthrough: our new GenAI feature set, specifically designed to make secure authentication and authorization for your AI-powered applications seamless and straightforward.

We understand the urgency of innovation, but not at the expense of security. With Auth0's GenAI features, you can empower your AI agents with precise, granular access control using minimal code.

Whether it's securely authenticating users interacting with AI chatbots or implementing robust authorization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, Auth0 provides the comprehensive solution you need to build with confidence.

Don't let security be an afterthought in your AI journey.
